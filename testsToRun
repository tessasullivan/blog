Starting with 65. Making api requests to server, API server was down so none of the following could be tested so these need to be run once the server is up.

Verify that user can register
Verify that user registering with an email already registered gets error message.
Verify that authenticated user is set in state
Verify that NavBar is rendered correctly after registering a new user

These worked when dummy name was hard-coded
Verify that NavBar has correct name after user is authenticated
Verify Login and Register are not available from NavBar for authenticated user.
